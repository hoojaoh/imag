## libimagstore

The store is the heart of everything. Here lives the data, the complexity and
the performance bottleneck.

The store offeres read/write access to all entries.

The store itself does not offer functionality, but has a commandline interface
"imag-store" which can do basic things with the store.


### Long-term TODO

- [ ] Merge with `libimagrt`
