## libimagrt

This library provides utility functionality for the modules and the binary
frontends, such as reading and parsing the configuration file, a builder
helper for the commandline interface and such.

It also contains the store object and creates it from configuration.

the `libimagrt::runtime::Runtime` object is the first complex object that comes
to live in a imag binary.

### Long-term TODO

- [ ] Merge with `libimagstore`
