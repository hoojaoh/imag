# Introduction

This document is the end-user documentation for imag, the plain-text personal
information management suite for the commandline.

The imag project wants to provide a set of tools (called "modules") for managing
personal information data on the commandline, where the data is stored in plain
text.
The modules should be scriptable, composable, traverseable and queryable.
The target audience for imag are power-users and commandline natives.

If you have any objections, suggestions for improvements, bugs, etc, please file
them.
